I got familiar with the online portal, signed up for my email and checked everything out. After that, I wanted to get ahead on my assignments so I went ahead and completed them. I had to define 25 terms, answer two discussion questions and create a list of PC parts to build a PC under $500. I have a really good feeling about what's to come."

    "body": "Today was not wasted. Even though I am literally changing paths as in what career I am pursuing, not one second of one moment has been a waste. Everything I have learned up to today, has been its own catalyst, in it's own way. I have ingrained and grown so much in the last year. So much in fact, that I often say to myself that you'd be un recognizable by your former self. I have learned a lot, but most importantly, I have learned how to learn. How to research problems long enough & hard enough until you eventually stumble upon a solution. How to not be defeated by rigorous concepts so heavy you cannot even fathom the mental gymnastics just to start. And I have grown a lot. Not by luck but by sheer choice to better myself through being the best positive version of myself I can imagine. And I cannot do it alone, I surround myself with the infinite interconnectedness of information and allow it to have me in formation. It's all boiling to a head and I cannot wait to see it's beauty."
